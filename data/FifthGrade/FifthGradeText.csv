"Do you have a favorite place to go—a place with family, good weather, and fun things to do like crabbing? "
I’m glad I do. New Jersey is my favorite place for many reasons.
"The first reason is my family. Over half of my family lives in New Jersey. When I visit, my cousins and I laugh and play all day and night. "
My uncles and aunts take me to the boardwalk where we ride roller coasters. 
We devour juicy caramel-covered apples and foot-long hot dogs. My family is fun to be with.
"The second reason for New Jersey being my favorite place is the weather. Instead of being hot and sweaty, it’s always cool and moist. "
"When I think about my visits, I can just feel the crisp fall breeze in my hair. I can just see the white, fluffy winter snow. "
I can just hear the soft spring trickles of rain splashing on the sidewalks. I can just feel the warm summer sun on my face. The weather is great!
"The third reason for New Jersey being my favorite place is crabbing. If it’s crab season, we crab. "
"We keep the blue crabs and the snow crabs, and we let the others go. Sometimes we catch crabs on hooks, and sometimes we lower crab cages into the bay. "
Then we pull them out later. One time my brother caught a crab so big that it got stuck in the crab cage! 
"The crab finally got out, but it hurt one of its legs and broke the cage trying. Poor crab!"
"For all these reasons, New Jersey is my favorite place to go. If you don’t have a favorite place, I think you should search for one. "
It’s good to visit a favorite place—a place where you can make special memories. 
"By the way, if you crab at your special place, be sure to get a big crab cage."
"Do you have someone who is great, spends time with you, cares for you, and is an important person? "
"Well, I do, and she has black hair, brown eyes, and a caring touch. That’s my mom."
My mom talks to me about many things. One of the things she talks to me about is what will happen when I grow up. 
"She tells me what to do in case of an emergency. And one day I had a really bad day with my friends, and she told me what to do about it."
"My mom and I spend a lot of time together. We play games, bake cookies, make necklaces, and draw doodle tricks. "
But our favorite thing to do is read. Our favorite book is If You Give a Mouse a Cookie.
"Mom takes me shopping at the mall. We buy toys and clothes, and we eat at the café. "
We usually get Chinese food or go to a McDonald’s restaurant. 
"When we ride the escalator, my mom pretends to fall back and says, “My shoestring’s stuck!”"
"My mom always laughs, and when she laughs she sounds like a hyena gone crazy! "
"She doesn’t laugh every day, but when she does, it’s hilarious, and I have to laugh, too!"
"My mom is the greatest. I love how she jokes around. She is always fun no matter what, and she gives me great advice. "
My mom is more than a mom  she is like my best friend!
"One day, on the way home from school, my mom told me she was going to make up some new rules for me and my brothers and sisters. "
"Before this, we knew she wanted us to be good, but we really didn’t have any rules. "
"Well, Mom took care of that. On Sunday, she started giving us the “house rules.”"
"Clean your rooms every other day. Be ready for dinner at 7:00 p.m. (that means sitting at the table, with clean hands). "
"If Mom is having a meeting in the house, be very quiet (that means turn down the music and the TV). "
"Be ready for bed at 9:30 p.m. (that means lying in bed, with clean faces). "
"Get up at 7:30 a.m. to get ready for school (that means your feet are on the floor, not just hanging off the bed). "
Take the garbage cans to the curb on Monday morning before school. Clean the bathroom on Thursday.
"Following these rules isn’t too hard, and sometimes it’s even fun. Other times, it can be tough. "
"For instance, if your room is really dirty and you can’t finish cleaning it on that day, you have to finish it on the next day, along with anything else you have to do. That can be hard."
"Mom made these rules because she loves us a lot. She wants us to learn how to be on time, be clean and neat, and be polite. "
"Every day, we try to follow her rules."
"I have a place I love to go. It’s a fort, or a clubhouse, where I can go with friends. "
"We can hang out there, plan neat stuff, eat, and rest. Shadow Fort is my favorite place for lots of reasons."
"First of all, there’s plenty of room for a few kids. It’s large (gargantuan to me). "
"The fort is 3 ft. 8 in. high, 5 ft. 3 in. long, and 3 ft. 6 in. wide. "
"There’s a place in back (we call it the pantry) for crackers, grapefruit, avacadoes, potatoes, carrots, berries, and Spanish moss. "
The roof is made of 4-ft. palm leaves and smaller fronds.
"Second, this fort is the first structure I ever built, with the help of my friend Kevin. "
We built it during a light shower. It was only a few vines that tangled together to make a kind of cave that we could crawl under. 
We worked fast to put palm fronds and leaves over the vines. “Quick! Let’s get inside!” I shouted to Kevin. 
"We got inside in the nick of time. It began to rain powerfully, and oh how the wind blew! But our fort kept us safe and dry. "
Later we named it Shadow Fort because it sits in a shady area.
"Finally, Shadow Fort is my favorite place because it has everything we need. "
"We keep food in the pantry, a small cot to sit on, and we even have a plywood door. One time Kevin fell out of a tree and hurt his ankle. "
"I helped him back to Shadow Fort where he rested on the cot. Then I made some “dinner”—crackers, carrots, and berries for dessert."
"Can you see why Shadow Fort is my favorite place? I hope so. When I’m there, I feel happy as a cat with cream!"
Owning a pet from the pound or Animal Rescue League has many advantages. 
"First of all, a child feels good about rescuing an abandoned or abused animal and giving it a whole new life. "
"Besides, if the animals from the pound aren’t adopted right away, they might be put to sleep. "
"Having a pet also means lots of responsibilities. A child has to feed, clean up after, brush, and exercise the pet."
Another great advantage of having a pet from the pound is the price of these cute and cuddly animals. 
"Pets from the pound cost a lot less than pets at a fancy pet store, which can cost hundreds of dollars."
"Once you adopt a pet from the Animal Rescue League, it will quickly become a part of your family. "
"If you are thinking of adopting a pet, you might consider choosing a dog or a cat. "
"Dogs and cats can bring lots of happy times to a family, and they can be excellent companions for a person who lives alone or someone who has lost a loved one. "
"Dogs are also a wonderful source of protection. Cats are funny, and they may help to calm people down when they are sad or mad."
Please consider adopting an animal. 
"If you remember all of the advantages of adopting a pet from the pound, you might find the bird, mouse, hamster, dog, or cat of your choice."
I’m writing to you about the Teacher-Who-Made-a-Difference contest. 
Ms. Wells made a difference to me! I think she should be the winner of your contest. 
Ms. Wells has done so much for me and for all of her students  this is the least I can do for her.
"First of all, Ms. Wells is helpful. She’s willing to help anyone in the classroom who needs help.  this is the least I can do for her."
"My teacher always helps us with worksheets. On Friday, she showed me how to do something in math. If you ask her for help, she’ll help you."
"In addition, Ms. Wells is a kind person. She always lets her students stay in from recess. "
"On February 26, she let our class have a Colonial Day. We got to dress up like colonists; it was a blast! "
"Not only is she kind to kids, but she’s also kind to other teachers and parents. She is always thoughtful and considerate."
"Lastly, Ms. Wells donates her time to kids. She donates her lunch recess for Student Council, which meets in her room. "
"Last fall, Ms. Wells promised me that she would come to one of my soccer games. "
"Guess what? She did, even though she had a lot of school stuff to correct and had to leave for Chicago."
"In conclusion, I think Ms. Wells should be the winner of your contest. "
She is helpful and kind and gives her free time to students. 
I know you will agree with me that Ms. Wells is a Teacher Who Made a Difference. She’s the best!
"Do you have a friend who loves you? Well, I did. Her name was Ann. She was a very close friend of mine. "
"She was almost like family to me. Ann was very kind, and she had bright blue eyes and curly gray hair. I loved her very much."
She invited me to go swimming every summer. We had a lot of fun all those summers. 
"But she could not get in the water most of the time because she was sick. Sometimes my sisters would come swimming, too. "
But it was better with just Ann and me because I just wanted to spend time with her.
Ann always listened to me when I had a problem. She was always there for me when I needed help on homework or had problems at school. 
"Sometimes she would let me come in her house, and she would give me something to eat. Most of the time it would be an orange and a soft drink."
"Last summer that all changed. Ann was diagnosed with cancer. Two weeks after Ann was diagnosed with cancer, she died. "
Her funeral was not too long after that. My mom did not let me go to the visitation at the funeral home or to the funeral ceremony.
"My heart broke. Ann was no longer there with me. Now, it’s been a year since Ann’s death, but I still dream about her. "
"Now it’s hard without her. My whole life has changed without Ann, and I really miss her. "
I know that everywhere I go there will always be a spot in my heart for Ann!
"It was a few months before my brother was born. My grandpa was perfectly fine, but then he went to the doctor for a checkup. "
The doctors found something wrong. They said they had to run some tests. Then they said he had colon cancer. 
"The doctors wanted to run more tests, so Grandpa had to stay in the hospital for a while."
"After he got home, I played with him. He would always play with me and do all sorts of stuff. "
I loved my grandpa. I liked to hear him play his harmonica. He even tried to teach me how to play it.
Then he had to go back to the hospital for surgery. He stayed there for a while. 
"When he went back home, we went to his house. When we got there, my grandpa was lying on the couch. "
"A couple of hours later, he died. I was scared, but I was only three years old. I was glad that I could see him and say good-bye. "
"My grandpa died August 27, 2009."
"Four months later, on December 31, 2009, my brother Chaz was born. I wish Grandpa could have lived to see my brother. "
"I really miss Grandpa, and so does my brother, even though he never met him. "
"My grandpa did know that the new baby would be a boy because the doctor secretly gave him a note, and it made Grandpa smile."
I am going to tell you about my dog and how I got him. 
"I don’t remember exactly how it happened, but at some point my parents asked if I wanted to have a dog. I, of course, said yes. "
"We couldn’t decide what kind of dog to get at first, but at last we found a great breed, the Shetland sheepdog. "
We called a good breeder. I was so excited about getting a dog!
"Before I knew it, I was on my way to the breeder. I went inside and saw dogs everywhere. "
"It was so hard to pick which one to get. I saw one I liked. It was a small blue merle. He looked perfect, so I asked if we could get him. "
"It turned out that he was too young to sell. So I kept looking. When I finally decided on one, we were all very happy. "
"It still took a few weeks until he was old enough to bring home. It seemed to take forever until the day came, but it did."
It was so exciting. We were on our way to pick up our newest family member. 
"When we went to pick him up, we realized that we had everything except the most important thing, a name! "
"On our way home, we came up with what seemed like the perfect name: Indiana. This name came from his head coloring, believe it or not. "
"His head was the same color as Indiana Jones’s hat. Like all dog names, it was shortened to Indy and eventually shortened to Ind."
"We loved Indy, yet it wasn’t all fun and games. We had to make major adjustments for him. "
"When he was young, we had to blockade parts of the house because they were too dangerous for him. "
Another reason we had to block things off was that Indy was not yet housebroken. 
"We also had to move my cat’s food because Indy kept eating it. Finally, we had to build him a kennel."
"Yes, we had to make a lot of changes, but Indy has changed a lot since the day we got him. "
"He is no longer a puppy, and he is housebroken! Now he’s pretty much everyone’s buddy. We are so glad we found him."
Have you ever run a business from a playhouse? My friends and I have. It is a bike shop. We call it Jet Bikes.
One day my friend Trent asked me and my brother Jared if we wanted to build a bike shop out of his old playhouse. 
"Jared and I said, “Yes.” So we went to get permission from my mom to go to Trent’s house and get started."
The first thing we did was get some things out of his garage. 
"We got old, rusty bolts; new, shiny nuts; black tape; wrenches; half-empty cans of oil; and screws. "
Then we built a new roof for the playhouse. We also had to clean the dirt and leaves out of it.
So far we’ve only worked on our own bikes because not many people know about our shop. 
We had to fix Trent’s chain a few times. We also had to fix his tire because it would go flat every five minutes. 
We changed the inner tube and also used some stuff called “No More Flats.” Now it never goes flat!
"When we are older, we plan on putting signs up around town and maybe even have a Web site. "
We will work on bikes as big as 20 speeds and as small as bikes with training wheels. We hope to have a lot of customers.
Do you think you’ll ever come here with a bike for my friends and me to work on? 
"I hope so because it would be fun to have some customers, and it might be fun for you to have kids fix your bike!"
"Wouldn’t it be superb to have one moment when you took the spotlight, to have everybody clapping for you and cheering loudly? "
I have had that once-in-a-lifetime opportunity—the day I took the spotlight!
"Sometime in February, my teacher told us all about the Woodmen of America speech contest. "
The topic was “people who have overcome obstacles in their lives.” 
"I thought my great-grandma Lorraine Parsley, who has had recurring cancer 13 times and is still living, would be perfect. "
She has overcome a lot of obstacles in her life.
"A couple weeks later, the class gave their presentations. My teacher had to pick three to five students to go on to the next level. "
I was one of them! Then the top five from each of the three fifth-grade classes competed. 
"The top seven would be the finalists; again, I was one of them! The top seven worked really hard. We had until March 15, 2001, to practice."
"March 15 rolled around. Before I knew it, I was in our school gym with people all around, including the judges, listening to every word I said. "
"I was the sixth to present. I was soon done; what a relief! I knew the top seven got ribbons, certificates, and pins; but I still wanted that trophy."
"After the seventh person finished, the judges made their final decisions. They announced the winners. "
"The third-place winner was Aunum, the second-place winner was Sarah, and the first-place winner was Kelli! I had just won first place! I was ecstatic."
That was my once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The students in the audience were going wild clapping and cheering! 
"That was a moment I will always remember, when I took the spotlight!"
"“Brian Robeson was stopped and stricken with a white flash of horror, a terror so intense that his breathing, his thinking, and his heart had nearly stopped.”"
This quote from the book Hatchet by Gary Paulsen shows why this book was too good to put down.
"Brian Robeson, an eleven-year-old boy, left his home in New York to go to Canada to see his father. "
He was on a plane (a two-person plane) in the middle of the Canadian forest when the pilot had a heart attack. 
Brian was stranded in the air with no real knowledge of how to fly a plane. 
Brian had to make the BIGGEST decision of his life: whether to keep flying or just let the plane drop. 
"If he let it drop, the only weapon he had was a hatchet."
"I feel that the author of this book, Gary Paulsen, is trying to tell his readers, “If you believe in yourself, you can survive on your own.”"
"I really liked this book because it sounded like it could really happen. I enjoy books like that, and I’d recommend this book to anyone. "
"Also, as I said, it kept me reading. I couldn’t put it down until I found out what was going to happen to Brian."
"The first thing I do when I wake up is lick myself with my pink, scratchy tongue. "
"Then I get up and stretch. First I stretch my front legs, then I stretch my back legs. Next, I go wake up Erin’s mom by scratching on her door. "
"Sometimes she sprays me with a squirt bottle filled with water to stop me, but mostly she gives me my favorite smelly salmon cat food with medicine in it. "
Then I sleep until lunch.
"When I wake up again, my stomach is growling, so I meow for more food. "
"Usually Erin’s mom gives me more, but sometimes she tells me to go eat my hard, dry cat food. "
"After lunch, I look out the patio door for birds, chipmunks, and squirrels. Sometimes, if I’m lucky, a chipmunk comes to the door and says hi. "
"Then I lunge at the window to say hello back, but he scurries away with his tail up in the air. Next, I go into the den and lie on the floor for a rest."
"Then I notice a fuzzy twitching thing right next to me, and I start to chase it. "
"After people start laughing at me, I realize that it is my own tail! After all that, I go into the living room and sleep again."
"When I wake up, it is supper time, and I am hungry. I want to eat again. Erin or her mom serves me some more scrumptious, smelly salmon cat food. "
Ahh! That tastes good. Then it’s time to go outside. I have an exciting time avoiding the sly coyotes and chasing after little night creatures.
"Finally, Erin’s dad opens the door to let me in. I go to Erin’s bed and sleep the rest of the night. "
"Then a new day arrives, and my adventures start all over again."
Have you ever been trick-or-treating when you came upon an old house and wanted to explore it? 
"Well, I’ll tell you a story about five kids, Jake, Zach, John, Bob, and Sean, who did it."
"They were trick-or-treating in their neighborhood, going door-to-door, when they came upon an old house. "
"“Let's go in,” Sean said. Everybody said they would."
"They started up the walk. The grass was overgrown, and there were a couple of broken windows. "
"They got to the door, and it opened by itself. They went inside. They had flashlights with them, so they turned them on. "
The house was covered in cobwebs.
"They saw a sign that said, “Beware,” and it was pointing up to the second floor. They decided to go upstairs. "
"When they got there, they saw a hallway with three rooms. One room had an old bed and a dresser. "
The second room was a bathroom. The third room was a sitting room.
"When they entered the third room, someone said, “Hello.” All the boys screamed and ran downstairs."
"When they were at the door, the voice said, “Don’t you guys want some candy?” They turned around and saw a man with candy standing in the hallway."
"They ran as fast as they could to Bob’s house. When they got there, they described the man to Bob’s mom. "
"She said, “That sounds like Mr. Craig. He lived there when I was a kid, but he died 30 years ago.”"
"It was 1:00 a.m. on a warm spring Wednesday, and it was storming outside. Casey was sleeping in her bed when she was awakened by a loud blast. "
"It was the tornado siren. Just then her parents rushed in and said, “Grab your pillow and one thing you want to save!”"
"She decided to grab her dog, who was sleeping in her room. Most of her other things she could replace, but she couldn’t replace a living thing. "
Then she heard a loud crash and ran downstairs with the trembling dog in her arms. 
"When they were all downstairs, they started listening to the weather radio. "
"The weatherman said that an F5 tornado was heading straight for Silver Lake Trailer Park, and, unfortunately, that’s where Casey lived. "
Soon Casey could hear the loud rumbling noise of her house being thrown this way and that. 
The basement door was shaking like a giant was trying to get it open. She put the pillow over her head and tried to forget what was happening.
"Many of Casey’s things were blown away—her bed, her dresser, her bookshelf, her books, and the painting her grandma had given her. "
"Some of her books were found far away from her house, and her broken-up dresser was found a half mile away."
"Thankfully, her dog and her family were okay, but many neighbors were not okay."
The tornado had lasted 20 minutes. So much had been lost in this terrible storm. Casey felt she would never be the same. 
She knew she would always remember the night that Mother Nature showed her destructive powers—the night Casey called Kansas Terror.
"ave you ever been in trouble and wanted to get away? The white-tailed deer can swim, run, hide, and fight to stay out of trouble. "
"If you want to know how they do it, read on."
"In early April, fawns (baby deer) are born. After a few weeks, the doe (the mother deer) leaves her fawns to find food. "
The doe leaves her fawns in a bushy place. The trees and grass can help keep the fawns from being seen by hungry predators. 
"The white-tailed deer has many predators, such as these: mountain lions, bobcats, leopards, lions, dogs, bears, tigers, coyotes, wolves, and even humans."
"The fawns’ camouflage hides them in April’s trees and golden grasses. In spring, the fawns’ fur is brown with white spots. "
"In summer, the fawns’ white spots disappear and never come back. In winter, their fur is gray, which helps them hide in the snow."
"When the deer see, smell, or hear something suspicious, they stick their white tails up to signal that danger is near. "
"The leader will run, and the others will follow."
"When a deer is chased to water, it knows what to do. The deer will win this battle. The deer runs into the water and swims to the deepest part. "
"If the predator thinks it’s going to win the battle, it is wrong. The deer will kick and thrash until the predator drowns or walks off wounded."
"If a deer is in a wide-open field and notices a predator, it will run zigzag to get away. It runs zigzag to confuse the predator. "
"If the deer ran straight, it could become a venison feast."
There is one more way that deer stay out of trouble. Bucks fight with weapons called antlers. 
"These are different from horns because they are attached to the skull, and horns are not. Antlers are made of bone and have vitamins in them. "
The deer can use its antlers to protect itself.
"Deer stay safe by hiding, swimming, running, and fighting. Whenever you see a deer raise its tail, you know that it has seen a predator."
Have you ever seen a dog with big ears and short legs? Was it so irresistibly cute you just wanted to take it home? 
"Chances are, you were looking at a Pembroke Welsh corgi. Let me introduce you to a dog of very high intelligence."
"Since Welsh corgis are so intelligent, they are easy to train. One of the jobs they are good at is herding sheep and cattle. "
Welsh corgis are also very loyal companions for people of all ages.
The Welsh corgi’s small size means it doesn’t take up much room as a pet. 
"Its average height is 10-12 inches, and an adult dog weighs approximately 25-30 pounds."
"Welsh corgis were originally bred in Wales. They come in several colors: red, sable, fawn, or black and tan, with or without white markings. "
"Their coats are a medium length, and they need to be groomed and exercised regularly to stay healthy. The corgi’s life span is 12 to 14 years."
"Welsh corgis are known for being bold but kind, friendly, and alert. They are friendly to all, good with children, and rarely aggressive. "
"Next time you see a dog that looks like a German shepherd in the front seat of a car, look again. "
"It may be a dog with a full-sized body and half-sized legs—not a height-challenged German shepherd. When it hops out, you might just drop your jaw."
"“It’s to bad that Mr. Griff is closing the shop,” Queen thought to her self."
"Queen and three dogs had been pets of Mr. Griff the owner, but now the shop was going out of buisness and Mr. Griff put all the furnistur outside his shop so people could look at them."
 Queen had to hold a meeting with the dogs. They loved the shop but they would probably have to go to the pound because Mr. Griff wouldn’t be able to feed them with what little money he had.
Queen meowed a couple of times and the dogs came bounding over.First Charlie then skip and then spot. 
Queen climbed up to the top of the velvet chair and got right down to the point. 
“You guys are going to have to leave hear or go to the pound. What do you want to do?”
"“We wouldn’t go to the pound for anything,” they chorused, “So I guess your leaving,” Queen said. "
Queen trying to hold tears back. 
She loved the dogs but she wouldn’t be able to come with them. 
She had a bad leg and when ever she tried to run pain shoot up her leg like a lightning bolt electricuting someone. 
Queen would have to go to the pound or be a street cat which she disliked. Do you boys have all your toys with you? 
Yes we do. Are you sure you will be ok without me? We think so. 
Queen followed the boys in the shop so she could hear there barks of goodbye to Mr. Griff. But he was talking to a men. 
After what seemed like an eternity the men left with a grin on his face. Mr. Griff also had a grin on his face. 
My wonderful pets we will be able to stay in the upstairs apartment because that wonderful man bought the shop from us but he is letting us stay upstairs still! 
The dogs jumped for joy and even though Queen couldn’t jump she started to purr. 
"When my usually calm mom frantically yelled my name right smack in the middle of my beauty sleep on that crisp, autumn, Saturday morning, I thought that I was in big trouble. "
"But, it turned out that my dream was about to come true."
"That morning I heard my mother calling me, “ Alicia! Come over here right now!” "
“I’m coming!” I said while thundering down the steps. 
"“Oh, look, look, look!”, my mom said, pointing to a picture of three adorable, grey, fluffy kittens on the computer. "
Someone was selling their new born kittens on the internet. 
"“Oh, Mama, could we get one? Please? Oh, PLEASE!” ,I squealed. "
"“Go ask your Baba!”, my mother replied. I stormed up the stairs to my father’s room and found him still sleeping in bed. "
"“Baba! There are some very cute kittens for sale! Could we get one? Please? Oh, please!” "
I yelled to my father near his face so he would pay attention. 
"“Go away!” my dad moaned. But, I managed to get him out of bed. He took a look at the kittens’ pictures and decided to see them in person."
"The drive to the kittens’ place was long, but, I was still very excited. It even felt like just a minute to get there. "
I was so happy that we might get a kitten. 
I thought it would be a good idea to get a partner for our super fat cat we already had. 
"On the way there, I imagined holding one of the kittens in my arms, sleeping with it, playing with it. "
Even though I had to clean kitten poop as I promised my parents.
"When we got there, my parents and the owner talked for a long long time. But, my parents finally agreed to get one of the kittens. "
It was the last one on sale. It was a boy with super fluffy fur! He had beautiful blue eyes and soft grey coat with stripes. 
He looked like a greyish white tiger with silver stripes. His father was a a white Persian cat while his mother was a brown and white patched Siamese cat. 
We got a box that he would comfortably fit in then we poked holes in it so he could breathe. 
"Then we wrapped him up in a blanket, put him into the box, and took him home."
"Since the trip was long, and that he meowed so much, I had to hold him half of the way while he purred like a baby purring machine! "
"Feeling his soft and plumed body was like holding a soft, furry, pillow that meowed adorably. "
"It was love at first sight. I was so happy, that I felt like I was a shooting star dancing across the sky."
"I had big trouble naming him. There were Thor, Dusty, and all types of names! "
"I finally landed with Thunder and decided to stick with it. But, right now his nick name is Fluffy for his fluffiness. "
"He is almost two years old now. Since we brought him home, my life was a whole different story. "
I got to watch complicate battles between (the fat cat we already had) and Thunder. 
Observing Thunder curiously adventure the house was a favorite treat for me. 
To sleep with him was like sleeping with a super fluffy pillow that purred like he was in heaven. 
"Now I have a free alarm clock. Thunder meows for me in the morning to get out of bed, so I can feed him, and even to clean more poop. "
You know at the beginning of this memoir how I said that I had no idea that my dream was about to come true? 
Well that dream was to raise a baby animal from the start of it’s life. Now it came true. 
"And that is the story of Fluffy! Uh, I mean Thunder."
"It was the best day ever! I ran out to the car, jumping up and down like an overexcited rabbit. "
"“Calm down!” my Grandpa said. I could hardly contain my excitement as we got in the car, and drove out of the driveway, towards my new sister!"
"One and a half hours later, I was at the airport, enjoying delicious chicken and broccoli at a Chinese restaurant. "
"The packed food court was very noisy, and I was starting to get a headache. But that didn’t stop me, I was just too excited! "
"It was only 30 minutes until the plane was supposed to land! All of the sudden, “Crunch! Ouch! Owwwwwww!” Yipe! "
"I had just bitten into a very, very spicy pepper, and I was in tears! I drank all of my orange gatorade, but it didn’t help. "
"“Eat some plain rice!” said my Grandpa. Grandpa was right, and soon, I could not taste any more spice at all. "
"“Come on,” said my grandpa, “To the waiting area!” When we got there, right at 7:00 p.m. , we heard the very bad news! "
"“Due to storms and bad weather, the flight coming from Detroit has been delayed for the next 2 hrs."
"We are sorry for the inconvenience.” So to pass the time, we got ice cream and wandered around."
"Two hours later, the airline played the same message! I groaned, ugh, this was taking forever! So, my Grandpa and I wandered some more. "
"Soon, only a few stragglers remained in certain parts of the airport. "
"It was getting much quieter, so we went to try to get some rest, but I couldn’t sleep at all! "
"45 minutes later, my Grandpa got a phonecall. “Okay, thank you. Bye.” I asked anxiously, “Who was it? My mom?”"
"“Yes, and bad news to go with it.” my Grandpa said. “What, another ­” “Canceled. And there is only one flight to DC left tonight. "
"“Lets hope they make it” I groaned, “Lets hope,” So again, we wandered around. And waited."
"Soon, there were only a few stragglers left, and most of the vast airport was dark. The last few shops and restaurants were closing. "
"My Mom had called to say they had made the last flight, but they weren’t due in for another hour still. Luckily, they had the last 3 seats on the flight. "
"“Ugh! 5 hrs. of waiting, and still no landing!!! This is as slow as molasses in January!”"
"Soon, it was midnight,and I was struggling really hard to stay awake! We had found the spot where the plane should land. "
"It was very quiet, and I was extremely bored! Finally, “Ding!” That was the plane! I sat bolt upright and watched. "
"It was a few minutes of waiting, but well worth it! Some of the last people to come through the gate where my Mom, younger brother Tommy, and ... my new sister Anne! "
"I could hardly believe it! She was tiny, and barely had any hair. She was about the size of a one­and­a half year old. "
Added to that was about 22 pounds! The gap in her top lip was like an upside down U. This was my new sister!
"Anne just stared at us very silently. She too looked exhausted, it had been a long trip home from China! "
"I couldn’t believe she was really here, and not just a picture any more."
"Unluckily for us, we ran into large construction on our drive home, and once more, the trip was taking much longer than it should have. "
"When we finally got home, I was so happy! I couldn’t wait for them to see the welcome home sign Grandpa and I had made a bit earlier. "
“Wow!” said my Mom. “It’s amazing!” There was a pile of tasty fortune cookies on the table. We snacked on them for a few minutes. 
"Anne was just looking around like “What is this place?” But there was something we all needed, and fast! SLEEP! "
"As I crawled into my cozy bed, I thought, “This is going to be amazing, but hard! "
"After over a year of waiting, crowned by what seemed like endless hours at the airport, Anne had finally come home, all of the waiting was officially over."
"Blue skies glisten, not a cloud in sight, as the sun’s beams distributed it’s radiance all over Makaha Beach. "
"It was a typical day with pounding shorebreak at the big M, or so I thought. "
"I was exhausted after doing laps in the deep with my M-O-M, for what seemed an eternity. "
"Mom would not depart from her ever-so-loving water. I had enough, so I swam to shore (nuha), all ALONE. "
"Swimming past the treacherous break and on to the sandy shore, I looked back toward the sea, back at my mother. "
"There she was, still in the deep, with no concept of time, just smiling. All of a sudden a small dot on the horizon speeds towards my mother. "
"Da Dan, Da Dan, Da Da Daaaa! (JAWS theme)"
"Everyone scurried to find their cameras, as if it were the antidote or reason they weren’t in the water. "
"Hords began flocking to my mother’s area. Lives flashed before my eyes, so did the luminescence of their cameras. "
"I started jumping with the last bit of energy I had in my body, waving my arms furiously, giving it my all! "
"Screams echoed from my heart to my mother’s longitude and latitude, “ Come back! Come Baaaaaack!” "
"My mom simply shook her head and grinned, as if to say, “No way!” Her stubbornness had made an appointment with Destiny."
"What seemed like a dot in the distance, was now vis a vis with Ms. “ I’m so stubborn”. The creature took a dramatic pause as it stared her down. "
It’s grey head was as wide as her shoulders and three times as tall her stick pin head. She was now the dot in comparison to this mammoth. 
"It was so close to her, I thought she would be eaten in front of my eyes. Horror filled me, as gravity won the battle. I sank into the sand. "
"What could it be? Everyone on the beach seemed to know, or they just wanted good shots. Way out, there she was still smiling. "
"It looked as if she was having a conversation with him. After their quick pep talk, the creature continued his speed to the other end of the beach. "
"The cluster of onlooking tourists ran as if they were in a marathon, following it’s path."
It beached itself. At that moment I realized it was an ... ‘Ilio holo i ka ua ua. It’s a Hawaiian Monk Seal! 
"Mom, came out of the water shortly after he did. She was stunned when she approached me. She was talking so fast I couldn’t understand a word she said."
I stood upright with an enormous smile on my face. I was happy to see her alive and finally out of the water. 
"I asked her calmly, “ What did it look like?” She turned Local /Pidgin on me, “Wow! Braddah was huge! I taut he was one world class swimma."
Braddah was one size 10x sporting one custom made wetsuit with a hood. 
"He stopped right front of me, den I was like, ‘whoa Hawaiian, wea you came from? You’re Awesome!’ He smiled and swam off.” "
"After hearing mom’s side of this story, I began with, ”So you didn’t hear me screaming to you?! You didn’t see the whole world racing towards your side of the beach?” "
"Mom laughed, and said she thought he was a famous world class swimmer! Well, she was right in the sense that, He is famous. "
By the end of that day we found out that He’s the oldest and largest Monk Seal that frequents Makaha Beach.
"I thanked GOD that day on the way home. God made my mother blind for a reason. The moral of this story is: See things with your heart, not your eyes. "
"The truth could be deadly, especially if you let worry get the best of you. Most times our difficulties become part of our charm and strength. "
"It makes YOU, unique. Either my mom was far sighted, or that would have been the last day I saw her!"
"As I lay in my cozy bed, fast asleep, I slowly awoke to the sound of my dads voice."
"“Wakey, wakey...time to shoot a gobbler,” were the words my dad whispered in my ear. I had a smile on my face before my eyes even opened. "
"The rest of the world was still asleep as we quietly crept through the house, careful not to wake my mom and sister as we gathered our hunting supplies."
"“Follow me,” my dad said quietly, as he headed toward the garage. He went to grab the guns out of the safe while I gathered the backpacks and knives. "
"As we headed back inside, I could hear the sound of coffee brewing and the aroma filled the air. "
Next to the coffee pot I spotted my thermos and opened it expecting to see coffee. 
"To my surprise, there were marshmallows floating on top, so I knew it wasn’t coffee, but hot cocoa for me!"
We grabbed our gear and headed out to load it in the truck. It was still dark outside and the cool crisp fall air felt good on my face. 
"I can still remember climbing into the truck and the sound the engine made as my dad turned the key...“vrum, vrum, vrum.” "
"As soon as the truck started, I cranked up the heat and started eating my granola bar. "
"As we backed out of the driveway, the only sound I could hear was the sound of the gravel grinding under the tires. "
"The only thing I could see, was the cloud of dust in the headlights."
"We drove for a good 20 minutes, and as we approached a steep hill, my dad said with anticipation, “we are almost there.” "
He slowly pulled off the gravel road and parked the truck. We got out and the sound of crickets chirping and locusts buzzing filled the field. 
"As I looked at the big field, I saw the most beautiful sight of fog on the horizon. "
"It was probably the most enjoyable sight I have experienced. “Follow me....and try to be extra quiet,” my dad whispered. "
"It was tough to walk quietly in the dark, through the dried up corn fields, “crunch.... crunch.... crunch.”"
"When we got to my dads secret spot, he snuck over to set up our turkey decoys. We laid  there under the dark sky for hours, trying not to move. "
"It was hard to stay awake, but as the sun crept over the horizon, the critters in the woods began to stir. "
"Before I knew it, I heard a distant gobble coming from the trees. Suddenly I was no longer sleepy. "
"Next thing I knew, a handful of turkeys flew out of the trees, but in the wrong direction. "
"My dad attempted to lure them towards us with his turkey call but no such luck. After about two hours, we decided to head back to the truck. "
I was pretty bummed but sometimes thats just the way it goes. We were almost to the truck when my dad stopped. 
"“Covy, come here quietly,” he whispered, “there are some turkeys across the road. Lets try to call them over here.” "
"Since they were across the street, we had to call them over to our side of the property so we could shoot them. "
"It was exciting to get another shot at bringing home a turkey. We quietly crept down into a creek and walked upstream, through the water. "
"We eventually had to cross the creek, and as we did my boots filled with icy cold water, but I didn’t mind. "
"Once we crossed, my dad set up the decoys at the top of the hill and I got set up in the bushes about twenty feet away. "
"We started calling them in with our best imitation of a turkey. After about ten minutes, two turkeys started making their way across the road. "
"I was thinking, “This could be it, my chance to finally shoot a turkey.” I was so excited I could hardly breathe. "
"As they made their way down a hill, one of them puffed up its tail feathers and headed straight for the decoy, while the other one came around the other side, and stopped about 10 feet from us, nearly blowing our cover. "
"My gun was aimed at the one by the decoy, and I knew I had to make a decision quickly. "
"As the big tom came strutting out from behind the decoy, my dad whispered, “Shoot when you’re ready.” "
"I slowly took the gun off safety, and slid my finger onto the trigger. My whole body was shaking with anticipation. "
I was so nervous and excited at the same time. I lined up the crosshairs on the turkeys head and pulled the trigger. 
“BANG!” My shoulder flew back and I saw turkey feathers flying everywhere! 
"As soon as I shot him, the other turkey jumped 4 feet in the air and went, “gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble,” looked around for his buddy, and then flew away. "
"My dad and I jumped up, high-fiving and yelling, “ALL RIGHT!” I was so excited I didn’t even feel the gun kick back. "
"All I was thinking about was that I just shot a turkey! “That was awesome, Covy! You did it!” my dad said, full of pride. "
"“You are officially a hunter now. Look out world, Covy has arrived!” he chuckled. “So are we going to eat it all tonight?” he asked."
“You bet we are!” I said. “Lets fire up the smoker when we get home.”
"As we headed home, I thought about my hunting experience. I learned how important it is to be quiet, so that you will blend in with nature. "
"I learned that you must be aware of what is happening around you, and you must also be patient to wait for the right opportunity. "
Life is full of surprises and new experiences. 
"I could have slept in that Saturday morning, but instead I got out there and was able to experience turkey hunting and create a memory with my dad that I will never forget. "
"This experience taught me to seek adventure in life. I learned that if you don’t get out there, you could miss out on a great experience."
"Before I moved to Hawaii, we took one last family vacation to Big Bear. We packed for a warm and relaxing weekend. "
"Most trips we took my grandma and grandpa would come along. This time was different because it was only my dad, mom, sister, baby brother, and myself."
The drive to Big Bear was very long. To help pass the time I played games on my Ipad. 
"Once we got on the mountain road, I put my Ipad away and watched out my window at all the nature that surrounded me. "
"There were pine trees so tall you couldn’t see the tops as we drove past, huge boulders and rock walls lining the road, we could see glimpses of small waterfalls as we curved along the mountain. "
"“I’m super hungry,” whined Kiera, my sister. My dad pulled over so we could stretch our legs and get Kiera a snack. "
"Remember I told you we packed for a warm vacation? Well, when we got out of the car it was so cold it was almost painful. "
"We all laughed about how cold it was, trying to stay out of the car to eat our snacks but it was too cold! "
“I can’t move my fingers anymore!” I said while shivering in my flip flops. 
We all tried to get in the car as quickly as possible. My dad turned on the heat full blast. 
"We sat there like the frozen chicken my mom takes out of the freezer, and waited until we thawed out. "
We continued our drive up to the cabin laughing about our freezing snack time.
"“Wow! It looks really neat,” I cheered as we pulled up to our vacation cabin. "
"The air smelled like Christmas trees, but it was still freezing, so we quickly unloaded our bags and ran inside. "
The cabin was awesome! My favorite thing was the attic space that was above the living room. 
"You had to climb a ladder to get up to the secret space. Once we climbed up, we saw all kinds of toys and beds."
“ I call sleeping up here!” I quickly yelled. “No!!!! That’s not fair!!” argued Kiera. “Stop fighting!” my dad and mom scolded.
We all gathered back in the living room and my dad lit the fireplace. The wood crackled and glowed as it warmed up the house. 
"It was an exciting night hanging out in front of the fireplace, playing family games, watching tv, and eating a yummy dinner."
The next morning we woke up and ate breakfast. We walked out back to feel the weather. 
"I was ready to put on my swim trunks, but when we opened the back door a burst of freezing cold air hit us in the face. "
There was some snow on the ground. I knew we wouldn’t be going swimming but hoped we could still do something fun. 
We got dressed and headed out into the town to find something to do. It was the strangest thing!! 
There was snow on one side of the street but not on the other. We continued driving until we found a museum.
The museum was filled with artifacts from the Gold Rush. We walked into the big yard at the museum and saw the Blacksmiths working in a barn. 
One of the men came over and started to talk to us. “Can I make you something neat?” asked the Blacksmith. “Can you make a knife?” I asked.
"“I won’t make you something that you can use to hurt your sister, but I will make you a peanut butter knife,” he said. "
"As we watched him make the knife, he told us stories of how life was during the gold rush. It took some time for him to finish the knife. "
"He would heat up the metal, pound it out, cool it and then reheat it. He did this over and over until the knife was done. "
"“Thank you,” I said as he handed me my peanut butter knife, and we walked over to the next exhibit."
I was super excited to be standing in front of a gold mine! The miner handed me a pan and explained how the technique of panning worked. 
I took the pan into my hands and dunked it into the water. The water was so cold it felt like a thousand knives going into my hand! 
"It was painful, but I was determined to find gold! "
"While I was panning, I would have to pull my hands out once in a while because the pain and cold water were too much. "
"I had to get a break for a second, but would continue panning right away so I could find gold. "
"The miner took my pan and helped scoop the gold I found into a small, clear, plastic vial with a black lid. “Good job! You found gold.” "
"The miner cheered. My dad wanted to try too, so he stuck in his pan and the first time he pulled it out the inside of the pan was sparkling. "
"He had more gold in his one pan than all of us had combined. We got to keep all of our gold. After we finished mining, we were pretty cold and hungry. "
"It was super fun, but it was time to go. The rest of our trip was pretty mellow. "
"We had a lot of fun hanging out together, playing games, and walking around the old town. "
"The weather never did warm up, but in a way it made our trip more memorable. "
"When it was time to leave I felt sad because we always had a great time there, and I knew we wouldn’t be back for a long time. "
"I do miss our family vacations in Big Bear, but now that we live in Hawaii, it feels like we are always on vacation."
